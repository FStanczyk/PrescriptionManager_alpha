# PrescriptionManager_alpha
Simple Prescription manager dedicated for hospitals and pharmacies. 

This system might finish counterfeit of prescriptions. 
Owner of the contract (most probably some Hospital Director), will becomean absolute admin who can give and remove admin permissions.

Admins can give/remove doctor permission and actualize drug list.

Doctors will be able to issue prescriptions.

In this way, we have decentralized application based on trust to the admins/doctors. Owner is the only admin whose admin permissions can not be removed.
Thanks to that, he has an absolute power, however he still has to trust an address to make him admin because admins also can give admin permission.

Admins should also be aware of who they give Doctor permissions (In a real world example, this would be done in the moment of hiring someone).
Howver Doctors can not give doctor permissions.

This application is in alpha version. It was not audited. I would not recommend to use it at this point.
If you see any problem, solution, issue, loophole, bug, please tell me.
